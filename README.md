# M3_Rain-Sensing-Automatic-Car-Wiper-using-Microcontroller

The turn of the century has seen a tremendous rise in technological advances in the field of 
automobiles. With 5G technology on its way and the development in the IoT sector, cars will 
start interacting with each other using V2V communications and become much more 
autonomous. In this project, an effort is made to move in the same direction by proposing a 
model for an automatic car wiper system that operates on sensing rain and snow on the 
windshield of a car. We develop a prototype for our idea by integrating a servo motor and 
raindrop sensor with an AT89C51 Microcontroller
